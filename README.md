Welcome to the Coinflip Game! This decentralized application (dApp) allows users to play a simple coinflip game using ERC20 tokens, leveraging the ethers.js library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, and built with React.js. The game also incorporates the ERC20 permit functionality for gasless transactions.

Overview
